# Go Rest Api

## Scaffolding-MongoDB

This branch just contains a folder structure and some code to establish a connection to mongoDB. I will be using/updating this whenever I work on a go-rest-api with MongoDB.

## MongoDB-Rest-Api

This branch contains a complete rest api with MongoDB. With this api you can do CRUD operations regarding music albums, in your MongoDB database.
